    "1. Run the cell below   \n",
    "2. Enter the file name along with extension (Example: RobertFrost.txt) \n",
    "3. Ensure the input file is present in same directory where the python code is being executed from\n",

    "##### __Expected Results__:\n",
    " - Displays the number of lines, words, characters and average length of the word in the input file\n",
    "     - Empty lines, blanks or spaces in the file are not counted as lines \n",
    "     - Space and new line character are not counted as a character. Except them all others (like comma, fullstop) are counted \n",
    "     - Average length of the word is rounded upto 1 decimal point\n",
    " - If file is empty, then error message is displayed stating empty file\n",
    " - If incorrect file name is entered or if file is not present in directory (same as where code is being executed from), \n",
    "   then error message will be displayed \n",
