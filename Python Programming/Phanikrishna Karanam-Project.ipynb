    "#### __Project__:  \n",
    "__Summary__: This project is about scraping data from CNN and Yahoo finance websites. The program gets the most active tickers from CNN website and details like open price, previous close price and volume are fetched from yahoo finance website for those tickers. All of these details are written into a text file in CSV format and also stored into a SQLite database. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### __Execution Instructions__:\n",
    "1. Run the cell below   \n",
    "2. Wait for 10-20 seconds for program execution to complete\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If CNN or Yahoo Finance websites are down, then please try again \n",
    "\n",
    "##### __Expected Results__:\n",
    " - Once user executes the program:  \n",
    "     - Program execution started message is displayed \n",
    "     - Program execution ended message is displayed after 10-20 seconds along with elapsed time details\n",
    "     - Active ticker details (Ticker, Open price, Previous close price, Volume) are written into stocks.txt file in csv format \n",
    "         - If file exists, then a new file with same name is written \n",
    "     - The same details as in the stocks file are also written into SQLite database   \n",
    "         - If StocksTable already exists, then its dropped and new one is created\n",
    " - Error message is displayed for below: \n",
    "     - If any of the websites are down\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \n",
    " - Validate the output stocks.txt file and StocksTable (within StocksDatabase.sqlite database) using SQLite DBbrowser \n",
    " - Notepad file stock.txt and StockDatabase.sqlite database will be created in the same directory from where Python code file\n",
    "   is being executed from \n",
    "\n",
    "##### __Algorithm__: \n",
    "` 1. Import libraries required by the program `  \n",
    "` 2. Display the program execution started message, collect the system time and set website up flag to True `  \n",
    "` 3. Open the CNN url and get the url handle `  \n",
    "` 4. If any error during url open, then display error message and exit the program `   \n",
    "` 5. If no error, then continue processing by reading the url handle and decoding the html message `  \n",
    "` 6. Using regex extract the text pertaining to Most Active tickers only, so that search criteria length is limited `  \n",
    "` 7. Extract all the most active tickers using regex by looking for text that appears before the ticker value `  \n",
    "` 8. Initialize two lists, one for writing into file and other for writing to database `   \n",
    "` 9. Loop thru all the active tickers and perform below:  \n",
    "     9.1 Initialize two lists, one for storing the html text content of each ticker and other for details about required\n",
    "         individual ticker values  \n",
    "     9.2 Open the Yahoo finance url for ticker  \n",
    "         9.2.1 If website is down, then set the website up flag to false and exit program execution \n",
    "         9.2.2 If no error, then continue processing \n",
    "     9.3 Read the url handle and decoding the html message\n",
    "     9.4 Using regex extract the text pertaining upto volume details, so that search criteria length is limited\n",
    "     9.5 Write the ticker name into the ticker details list as first entry \n",
    "     9.6 Extract the open value from text created in 9.4. Convert the value into float and write into detail list\n",
    "     9.7 Extract the previous close value from text created in 9.4. Convert the value into float and write into detail list\n",
    "     9.8 Extract the volume from text created in 9.4. Remove the commas in value text, convert into integer and write the value \n",
    "         into detail list\n",
    "     9.9 Append this detail list having details about one ticker into main list as one item \n",
    "     9.10 Convert this detail list also into a string using join function and delimit each list item using a comma. Also add a \n",
    "          new line character at the end of the string. Use this string and append into file write list `  \n",
    "` 10. If website flag is set to True:  \n",
    "     10.1 Open the stock.txt file in write mode and obtain the file handle \n",
    "     10.2 Using writelines function and the file write list created in 9.10, write into the file \n",
    "     10.3 Close the file \n",
    "     10.4 Connect to SQLite StockDatabase and connect to the cursor \n",
    "     10.5 Drop the StocksTable if it exists \n",
    "     10.6 Create the StocksTable with columns (Ticker TEXT, OpenPrice REAL, PrevClose REAL, Volume INTEGER)\n",
    "     10.7 Using executemany command insert the records into table at once by passing the main list created in step 9.9\n",
    "     10.8 Close the cursor \n",
    "     10.9 Commit the insert performed into database\n",
    "     10.10 Close the connection\n",
    "     10.11 Print the elapsed time taken for program execution\n",
    "           10.11.1 Subtract the current time from time captured in step 2, to get the elapsed time `  \n",
    "` 11. Display program execution ended message `  "
