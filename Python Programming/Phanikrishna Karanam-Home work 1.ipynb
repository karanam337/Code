    "#### __Question 5__:  \n",
    "__Summary__: Accept 2 set of ((x1,y1) and (x2,y2)) co-orordinates that are opposite end of a rectangle. Prompt user to enter co-ordinates of third point (x,y). Valid inputs are only integer or float type values. If third point lies within / on rectangle, then display True else False. Prompts user to check if they want to continue for another test.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### __Execution Instructions__:\n",
    "1. Run the cell below   \n",
    "2. Enter valid integer or float values (either positive or negative) that are co-ordinates of opposite ends of rectangle   \n",
    "3. Enter 3rd co-ordinate value (x,y)\n",
    "3. Follow prompts for error inputs or to rerun the test\n",
    "\n",
    "##### __Expected Results__:\n",
    " - If the 3rd point (x,y) lies within or on the boundaries of the rectangle, then display True else False\n",
    " - If an invalid input is entered, an error message will be displayed and user will be prompted to re-enter. \n",
    " - Execution will resume from point of error / re-entry\n",
    " - At end of execution, if user enters 'Y' or 'y', execution is run again. If 'N' or 'n' is entered, then program terminates  \n",
    " - When user is prompted Y/N to continue and an invalid input is entered, then error message is displayed to re-enter\n",
    "         \n",
    "##### __Algorithm__:\n",
    "` 1. Accept 3 sets of co-ordinates ((x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x,y)) \n",
    "     1.1. If invalid values (other than integer or float) are entered, display error message and prompt for re-entry\n",
    "     1.2. After re-entry of value from user, resume execution from point of error\n",
    "     1.3. Once valid input is entered, store the input entry into a list variable  `       \n",
    "` 2. Once all 6 values are entered correctly, display entered co-ordinates  \n",
    "     2.1. Using 1st and 2nd points as opposite ends of rectangle, check if 3rd point lies within or on boundary of rectangle \n",
    "          2.1.1. If 3rd point lies inside or on boundary of rectangle, then print 'True' \n",
    "          2.1.2. Else print 'False' \n",
    "          2.1.3. Prompt user to check if they want to continue. Valid inputs are 'Y/N' or 'y/n'\n",
    "                 2.1.3.1. If Y/y -> initialize all required input variables and resume execution from step 1\n",
    "                 2.1.3.2. If N/n -> display 'Good bye!' and exit program\n",
