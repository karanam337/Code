    "#### __Question 1__:  \n",
    "__Summary__: In this game, a scrambled word is given to user for unscrambling. If user is unable to unscramble, user can request for meaning of the word and respond. If the user responds correctly, a new scrambled word is provided for user to respond, if they chose to continue with the game.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### __Execution Instructions__:\n",
    "1. Run the cell below   \n",
    "2. Enter the file name (place it within the python code library) \n",
    "3. Follow the prompts to play the game \n",
    "4. To rerun the test, execute the code cell again and follow the prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \n",
    "If user is unable to unscramble the word and enters incorrect answer, they are prompted with an option to continue (Yes / No). If they choose to continue, then they can enter the answer again. \n",
    "\n",
    "The words are chosen in random. There is a possibility that program can choose the same word again in random. \n",
    "So please try and check the program execution multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "##### __Expected Results__:\n",
    " - Once user enters the file name, user is prompted with a scrambled word:  \n",
    "     - If user successfully responds with the unscrambled word, they will be prompted with a Yes / No for continuing\n",
    "         - If Yes, a new scrambled word is prompted to user \n",
    "         - If No, the program exits with a Goodbye! message \n",
    "     - If user is unable to guess and asks for help by entering '?'\n",
    "         - The meaning of unscrambled word is displayed to user and then prompted to guess the original scrambled word \n",
    "     - If user guesses the word incorrectly, then 'wrong try' message is displayed. \n",
    "       User is prompted if they want to continue with the game:  \n",
    "         - If Yes, then user is prompted to guess the original scrambled word again \n",
