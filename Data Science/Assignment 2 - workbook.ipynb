The above operations are performed in response to the microprocessor receiving the single instruction. Text flow in and around irregular containers Providing text flow in or around an irregular container, such as a non-rectangular graphic, is disclosed. In the case of flow around a container, the intersection, if any, between a proposed text rectangle and the irregular container is determined. A valid rectangle, if any, that is not within the bounds in the x-direction of an area of intersection between the proposed text rectangle and the graphic is identified as a valid text area within the proposed text rectangle. In the case of flow around a container, one or more difference areas, if any, in which a proposed text rectangle is present but the container is not present are found. A valid rectangle, if any, that is not within the bounds in the x-direction of any of said one or more difference areas is identified as a valid text area within the proposed text rectangle. Method and apparatus for image blending Methods and apparatuses for blending two images using vector table look up operations. In one aspect of the invention, a method to blend two images includes: loading a vector of keys into a vector register; converting the vector of keys into a first vector of blending factors for the first image and a second vector of blending factors for the second image using a plurality of look up tables; and computing an image attribute for the blended image using the blending factors. Mounted shock sensor This application is directed to a shock sensor mounted in an electronic device. The shock sensor includes both active and passive shock detection methods that allow a technician to determine whether the electronic device was subjected to a shock event that exceeded an impact threshold level. The shock sensor may include shock detection contacts that form an electrical circuit that remains open in the absence of a shock event that exceeds an impact threshold level. In response to a significant shock event, a movable component or substance of the shock sensor may move from a first position to a second position, thereby closing the electrical circuit formed by the shock detection contacts. The change in circuit may be detected and used to provide active indication of whether the electronic device has been subjected to a substantial shock event. In addition, the shock sensor may be observed to passively determine whether the electronic device has been subjected to a substantial shock event. Operating NAND cells using multiple levels for each data value A system and method, including computer software, for storing digital information uses multiple NAND flash memory cells. Each memory cell is adapted to receive charge during a write operation to an analog voltage that corresponds to a data value having a binary representation of more than 4 bits. An analog-to-digital converter converts the analog voltage from each memory cell into a digital representation of the analog voltage during a read operation of each cell. Software setup system Methods and apparatuses for automatic system setup. At least one embodiment of the present invention stores the setup configuration information (e.g., in files and/or in directory servers). The setup configuration information is stored (e.g., using a configuration file naming scheme) so that the configuration information for a particular machine can be found. A setup daemon on the machine searches for suitable configuration information in a number of places, such as: in a location in a local file system, in locations in mounted file volumes, and directory servers. The configuration information may be encrypted, and the setup daemon searches for the decryption key in a similar fashion. Methods and systems for processing objects in memory Methods and apparatuses to create and manage volatile graphics objects in a video memory are disclosed. An object is created and marked as volatile. The volatile object is stored in a video memory of a graphics subsystem. A volatile marking indicates that data for an object is not to be paged out from the video memory to make room for other data. The video memory space occupied by the volatile object is indicated as a volatile storage, in a data structure. Another object is written into at least a portion of the video memory space, which is occupied by the volatile object, without paging out data for the volatile object. In one embodiment, at least a portion of the volatile object is referenced or used while another object is formed. The volatile object may be discarded after being referenced or used to form another object. Virtualization of graphics resources Graphics resources are virtualized through an interface between graphics hardware and graphics clients. The interface allocates the graphics resources across multiple graphics clients, processes commands for access to the graphics resources from the graphics clients, and resolves conflicts for the graphics resources among the clients. Hot unpluggable media storage device Improved techniques for rendering a peripheral device removable (e.g., unpluggable) are disclosed. According to one aspect of the invention, the peripheral device is rendered removable from a host computer without preparatory user actions. In effect, the peripheral device can be automatically prepared for removal in the event that its user removes (unplugs) it from its host computer. According to another aspect of the invention, the peripheral device includes a data storage device that is mounted to a file system of the other computer when the other computer desires access to the data storage device. Otherwise, the data storage device is normally unmounted so that if the peripheral device were to be removed (e.g., unplugged) no harm or damage to data stored therein would occur. These aspects of the invention can be utilized alone or in combination with one another. The invention is particularly well suited for peripheral devices that are media players which are “hot” unpluggable without detrimental consequences. Method and system for network-based purchase and distribution of media Methods and systems for network-based purchase and distribution of media are disclosed. The purchase and distribution of media by these methods and systems are not only secure but also controlled. The security restricts access to media within media files during downloads as well as while stored at a server and/or client. For example, a potential purchaser can search and browse through numerous media items on-line that are available for purchase. The potential purchaser can thereafter purchase one or more media items on-line with great ease. Upon purchasing a media item, the content for the media item can be downloaded over the network to the purchaser. The content for the media item is then encrypted for the purchaser's use and stored on the purchaser's machine. Thereafter, the purchaser can make use of the media item (e.g., play the media item). Improved graphical user interfaces suitable for reviewing, browsing, previewing and/or purchasing numerous media items are also disclosed. Method, system, and graphical user interface for text entry with partial word display A computer-implemented method for text entry includes receiving entered text from a user, selecting a set of candidate sequences for completing or continuing the sequence, and presenting the candidate sequences to the user, wherein the candidate sequences include partial words. The candidate sequences are identified based on usage frequency weights stored in a tree data structure. A graphical user interface for text entry includes displaying a current input sequence of characters and the identified partial words. Connector receptacle housings having reduced-wear finger contacts and reduced seam visibility Structures, methods, and apparatus that provide connector receptacles that have a reduced tendency to scratch and otherwise mar connector inserts, have an aesthetically-pleasing appearance, and have an improved tactile response when inserts are inserted. Various examples reduce scratches and wear by utilizing domes, cylinders, balls, or other structures as finger contacts in a connector receptacle. Another example provides aesthetically-pleasing connector receptacle enclosures by forming receptacle enclosures using the same type of material, or material having the same or similar color or texture, as is used for enclosing the electronic device that includes the receptacle.

To write data to the buffer at a particular position in the buffer that corresponds to a particular time, an application is awaken a period of time (“client-side offset”) before the driver reaches the position. The period of time is computed based on a variety factors. One factor is the amount of time the system interface assumes an application uses to write the unit of data to the buffer. For operations that entail the application inserting data into the buffer, the application may specify a weight value to apply to the factor to reduce it and the latency period. Controlling access to a database using database internal and external authorization information Techniques for using both database internal and database external authorization information to control access to a database are disclosed. Corporate accounts which are generally used in many corporate environments (e.g., operating system accounts) can be defined as “external” database accounts with database external authorization information that define database external access privileges for a database. The database external access-privileges are used in conjunction with a set of complementary database “internal” access privileges defined for database internal accounts. An integrated access-privilege set is generated and used as a single source to authorize access to a database regardless of whether database internal or external accounts are used to access the database. As a result, databases can be integrated with various non-database entities (e.g., corporate computing systems).

Cache management using historical access information A caching manager calculates cache priorities for accessed items, including items not currently stored in the cache. The cache manager determines an item's cache priority as a function of the item's access frequency, retrieval cost and size. The cache manager dynamically updates cache priorities as items are accessed. When the cache is full and a non-cached item is accessed, the cache manager uses cache priorities to determine whether to overwrite a cached item with the non-cached accessed item.

The determination of a quant to use to encode a frame is informed by the fullness of the buffer. The encoding manager adjusts the quant to use (and thus the aggressiveness of its encoding) in response to the amount of overflow generated thus far by the encoding of the video sequence.

The processor is configured to execute the load-swapped instruction by loading a vector from a naturally-aligned memory region encompassing the source address, and in doing so rotating the bytes of the vector to cause the byte at the specified source address to reside at the least-significant byte position within the vector for a little-endian memory transaction, or causing said byte to be positioned at the most-significant byte position within the vector for a big-endian memory transaction. In a variation on this embodiment, the processor is also configured to execute a store-swapped instruction directed to a destination address by storing a vector into a naturally-aligned memory region encompassing the destination address, and in doing so rotating the bytes of the vector to cause the least significant byte of the vector to be stored to at the specified destination address on a little-endian processor, or causing the most significant byte of the vector to be stored to the destination address said on a big-endian processor, or causing the specified byte to be stored to the destination address in the case of an endian-specific store-swapped variant.

Secondly, the processing logic snaps the text object to the cursor so that the text object follows the cursor without obscuring text at the insertion point. Finally, when the computer user selects the final insertion point, the selected text is visually zoomed from the source location to the final insertion point. Method and apparatus for organizing information in a computer system A method and apparatus for organizing information in a computer filing system. The method and apparatus include the creation of a pile comprising a collection of documents and displaying a graphical representation of the collection of documents. The method and apparatus further include browsing the collection of documents by pointing a cursor at a particular item in the collection of documents to reveal an indicia for the particular item in the collection of documents. The filing system can automatically divide a pile (e.g. a collection of documents from an electronic mail network) into subpiles on the basis of the content of each document in the pile, and the filing system, at the users request can automatically file away documents into existing piles in the computer system on the basis of a similarity match between the content (or other internal representation) of the document and the content (or other internal representation) of existing piles in the computer system. The filing system can also create a pile from a sample document by using the internal representation of the document as the internal representation of the new pile.

Method and system for synchronous operation of linked command objects A system and method provide for synchronous operation of linked command objects in a general purpose software application. The software application provides a user with a variety of operations that manipulate available data objects. The software application manages the data objects in a number of contexts. Each context manages the existence and execution of a number of command objects. Each command object operates on one or more data objects in its context. To support synchronous operations that affect the state of data objects in more than one context, command objects are linked to each other. When one command object is executed, the context of the command object identifies a command object linked to the executed command object and initiates the execution of the linked command object via the context that manages that command object. This synchronization allows for synchronous undo and redone operations. The delete states of the command objects are also synchronized. Deleting a command object destroys it, and prevents it from being undone. When one command object is deleted the command object linked thereto is also deleted, thereby preventing the linked command object from being independently undone resulting in an inconsistent state of the contexts.

For example, the host device can determine whether a corruption event occurred in association with a media file (e.g., whether the media player skipped the media file as unplayable). In another example, the host can determine whether portions of a media player's storage device are damage or “bad.” If a bad portion is detected, the host device can identify media stored on the portion as corrupt. After identifying corrupted media, the host can replace the media with valid copies.

When the client selects the desired media, it requests the selection from across the network. The server then delivers the selected media. Reporting flash memory operating voltages Apparatus and associated systems, methods and computer program products relate to using information stored in a flash memory to adjust the operating voltage supplied to the flash memory. The voltage information indicates a minimum operating voltage at which to operate the flash memory device. In general, operating a flash memory device near a minimal operating voltage may substantially minimize power consumption. The minimum operating voltage for individual flash memory devices may vary from IC to IC, by manufacturing lot, and by manufacturer. In a product, the minimum operating voltage for a particular flash memory may be determined, for example, by a controller built-in to a flash memory reporting (automatically or in response to a query) the minimum operating voltage (e.g., 2.5 V, 3.15 V) to a memory controller or microprocessor. The stored voltage information may further include information to adjust the operating voltage based on temperature. Managing read requests from multiple requestors Techniques are described herein for expanding the range of data targeted in I/O requests made by clients, so that the expanded range results in aligned I/O operations within the file system. Data that is included in the expanded range, but was not actually requested by the client, is trimmed off the data chunk returned by the file system, so that the client receives only the data required by the client. The blocks that contain the partially-read data are cached, so that they can be provided to the clients in response to subsequent I/O requests, without having to retrieve the blocks again from the file system. The I/O requests of multiple clients are handled by a read scheduler that uses a single global queue for all such requests. When appropriate, the read scheduler creates companionship relationships between the requests, and services the “companion” requests based on the data returned for the requests with which the companion requests are associated. Distributing and synchronizing objects Distributing and synchronizing objects is disclosed. An object (including the data and behavior for the object) is copied into local address space.

For example, a policy may provide for synchronization that is based temporally (e.g., every 10 minutes or daily at 10:00 P.M.) or based on the type or number of messages transmitted. A default policy may provide for the synchronization of local objects whenever a client issues a request from the remote server. The remote server transmits any updated object information when it responds to the local object request. The updated object information may be utilized to synchronize the objects.

Software or other information integrity verification using variable block length and selection An integrity verification process and associated apparatus to detect tampering or other alterations to computer code (software) or other computer files, and especially useful to detect tampering with code by hackers who might try to plant their own malicious code in the software. To make the verification process more robust versus hackers, each e.g., object code file to be protected is first selected using some sort of rule, then partitioned into variable length blocks or portions, the lengths varying in an unpredictable manner. Each portion has its checksum or hash value computed. An accompanying verification file is created which includes a vector for each portion including the portion's start address in memory, length, and the computed checksum or hash value. When the code is later to be run (executed) the verification file is conventionally read and each portion is verified by computing its checksum or hash value using the same algorithm as before, and comparing that to the value in the associated verification file vector. Lack of a match in the two values indicates tampering, so execution of the code can be halted.

An autorelease pool is created at the beginning of a new duty cycle. The autorelease pool retains the newly allocated memory space during the duty cycle. The autorelease pool is automatically disposed of at the end of the duty cycle. As a result of disposing the autorelease pool, the newly allocated memory space is reclaimed (i.e., deallocated). This is useful in distributed networks where different programming conventions on remote and local machines made the memory management task particularly difficult. This is also useful in an object-oriented programming environment. Query result iteration Systems and methods for processing an index are described. A pulse in an inverted index refers to a group of items that do not occur in any other pulse in the index. When processing a query against an inverted index in which pulses are present, the query is processed against a single pulse.

In some embodiments, index updates are applied to the query result obtained from a single pulse to provide an efficient and up to date query result. Accessing data storage systems without waiting for read errors Improved techniques for accessing data storage systems are disclosed. These techniques detect, correct and prevent undesirable access delays experienced in storage systems. “Slow-access” refers to an access operation that does not successfully complete within a predetermined amount of time. When slow-access is detected, an attempt is made to provide data by other means rather than waiting for the access operation to eventually complete. By way of example, parity information is used to generate data rather than waiting beyond a predetermined amount of time for a “slow-read” operation to complete. In addition, preventative measures can be taken to avoid reoccurrence of a “slow-access” operating once it has been identified. These preventative measures, for example, include rewriting the same data to the same data section that caused the slow-access problem or remapping the section to another section in order to avoid the same section of data to cause another slow access problem.

These visual cues are rendered as a display region having multiple other display areas, components or interface components that provide the user with a location for initiating actions upon the file. User input provided to the timeline component generates a selection overlay that indicates a selected area of the audio file. The user can perform numerous actions with that audio file, such as copying and pasting. The user can do this more quickly and efficiently because the user is not required to switch tools. Everything is accomplished “modelessly.” Multiple instances of the selection overlay applied, for example, across multiple audio tracks may achieve even more powerful results.

Generation and use of masks in MPEG video encoding to indicate non-zero entries in transformed macroblocks During Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) video encoding a two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (DCT) is performed on data representing an original image. The resulting coefficients are then quantized, which typically results in many zero coefficients. Because of the nature of most video data, most higher-order coefficients are typically zero and the lower-order coefficients (i.e., those grouped towards the upper left of the matrix) are more likely to be non-zero. To reduce the lengths of runs among the lower-order coefficients, the coefficients can be encoded in a zig-zag pattern. In one embodiment, the zig-zag pattern is maintained and one or more masks are generated based on the output of the quantization phase. The one or more masks are used to identify the coefficients within the matrix that are non-zero. This reduces the number of accesses to memory required to encode the non-zero coefficients and runs of zero coefficients.

Messaging system for managing communications resources Embodiments of the present invention relate to a messaging system for managing communications resources and are particularly suitable for providing a means for subscribers of a telecommunications network to continue participating in a communications service that would otherwise be ended due to the calling party having a low or zero balance. Embodiments of the invention are generally applicable to users of a mobile network. Embodiments of the invention provide a messaging system for use by the telecommunications network to transmit a message to a remote party, where the remote party is identified by means of a telephone calling identifier associated with a call setup request for a telecommunications session received from a user of the telecommunications network. The messaging system comprises a storage system for storing data providing a predetermined definition of message content to be sent to the remote party. In response to trigger event such as determining that the account balance available for said user participating in the requested communications session is below a predetermined threshold, the messaging system is arranged to initiate the transmission of a message to said remote party. The transmitted message contains message content that is defined at least in part by said definition of message content and can comprise a “call me message”. This thereby ensures that a “call me” message reaches the remote party. Automatically transmitting images from an electronic camera to a service provider using a network configuration file A network configuration file is generated at a host computer and downloaded to a digital camera. This file contains instruction information for communicating with a selected destination via a communications interface. The digital camera includes a “send” button or LCD icon which allows the user to easily transmit one or more images via a wired or wireless communications interface to a desired destination, which among other possibilities may be an Internet Service Provider or a digital photofinishing center. When the user selects this option, the communications port settings, user account specifics, and destination connection commands are read from the network configuration file on the removable memory card. Examples of these settings include serial port baud rate, parity, and stop bits, as well as account name and password. Secure systems management To effect a change to the system, a user process makes a request. An interface receives the request, and attempts to authenticate the user. Assuming the user is authenticated, the interface determines the user's UID. The interface determines a provider process that can make the requested change, and forwards the request to the provider process. The interface also assigns the user's UID to the provider process's eUID. The provider process then attempts to make the change, provided the change can be made given the eUID assignment. The provider process then attempts to run under the new eUID, enabling the system to prohibit it from doing something that is not authorized for that user. This protects the system from inadvertently executing management operations by one provider process that is not expected or intended by the user of another provider process. Method and system for network resources allocation A method of recording allocation of resources in response to a request for a data item to be transmitted to a device in the network where the request comprises data indicative of one or more requested items. The device is typically a mobile device and the requested items can be key words making up a search request or can be web site names indicating web sites of interest to the user. In response to the request, data listings having items generating a match with the requested data item are identified and data indicative of a network location corresponding to the or each matched data item are retrieved. In addition data indicative of an amount of data and a resource allocation associated with the set of data accessible via the network location are retrieved and these data, together with a network subscription associated with device and the amount of data, are used to evaluate actual usage of network resources when accessing the set of data. If data are subsequently requested from the network location the evaluated actual usage is offset against the resource allocation so as to identify an amount of usage of network resources to be charged to the network subscription, and a record associated with said data listing is updated so as to log said resource allocation event. OFDM system with reverse link interference estimation A new method of performing interference estimation to allow the data packets to be efficiently delivered in an OFDM system.

Numerical results show that the CIR estimation error could be very small if a sub-channel is considered as the minimum transmission unit. In terms of the aggregate throughput, the interference estimation method can provide a significant gain.

Further, multiple VMSs may be implemented for a single ad hoc network in order to bundle bandwidth. Clients may also extend the communication range of the VMS to a new cell station in order to enable earlier initiation of cell station handoff.

The characteristics of the pre-distorter comprise a distortion relative to a linear transfer function that compensates for the distortion of the transfer function of the power amplifier. System and method for providing identity hiding in a shared key authentication protocol A system and method is provided for hiding an initiator's identity (ID), e.g. a ClientID, in a shared key authentication protocol, using authentication based on a hint of the ID. The hint is a function of the ID which cannot be readily inverted to produce the initiator's identity, for example, a hash function over the ID, such as a modular N sum hash of the initiator's identity where N corresponds to N hash buckets in a shared key database; a cryptographic hash over the ID and a corresponding shared key; or a function of the ID which cannot be readily inverted to produce the initiator's identity and a pair of MAC values wherein the MAC values are compared to find a shared key. The resulting hash may be reduced to a required number of bits for identification of a hash bucket in the database. The system and method thereby provide a computationally efficient method of protecting, or hiding, a client ID in a client-server system for shared-key authentication, which avoids the requirement of known systems to send the client ID in clear text early in the message exchange, which leaves known shared-key protocols open to passive and active identity disclosure attacks. Image signal processing An image signal is processed by deriving measurements representing the luminance of a signal; calculating values relating to the local mean, the local standard deviation, the local maximum and/or the local minimum; and computing therefrom local standard coordinates such as z-scores which are independent of brightness and contrast.

Method for determination of discontinuous transmission, frame erasure, and rate This invention enables determining whether a received frame is an erasure, a DTX mode frame or a CONT mode frame, using a metric m derived from the log likelihood ratio (LLR). The new metric is obtained by calculating the mean for the LLRs for a frame; a threshold T for this metric is also established. A received frame is declared a CONT frame if the CRC value indicates a successfully recovered frame, and m>T. A received frame is a DTX frame if m<T. Finally, a frame is declared an erasure if the CRC value indicates a failed frame, and m>T. The mean absolute LLR may also be used for determining the transmission rate of the system. In this case, a voice frame is decoded for all rates available; the transmission rate is that which corresponds to a passed CRC and has the highest m.

The gate-source capacitor and the match capacitor can each be adjusted by recalling capacitor values from memory that correspond to the selected sub-band, and connecting selected capacitor components in response to the recalled capacitor values. Integral fuel cartridge and filter An integral fuel cartridge and filter apparatus includes a fuel cartridge, a filter housing coupled to the fuel cartridge, and a filter coupled to the filter housing. Image-capturing apparatus A digital camera enables high-speed zooming operation without use of a zoom lens. Light originating from a fixed-focal-length lens is split into two beams by a beam splitter, to thus form respective images on a first image sensor and a second image sensor. The first image sensor and the second image sensor are equal to each other in terms of the number of pixels, but differ from each other in terms of a pixel size. The first image sensor acquires a wide image, and the second image sensor acquires a telephotography image. An output is produced by means of switching between the first image sensor and the second image sensor, in response to zooming operation. When the image from the first image sensor is recorded, focus detection is performed by use of an image signal from the second image sensor, to thus effect automatic focusing.

The regions are associated with the capture records of respective groups. Transport for wireless radio access networks A radio access network includes a transport network layer; a radio network layer having a layer 2 network for communicating between entities within the radio network layer by exchanging datagrams having a predetermined format used only within the radio network layer. Accordingly, the present invention provides for a true decoupling at layer 2 between the radio network layer and the transport network layer. Addressing at layer 2 can enable both connectionless and connection oriented using an overlay connectivity model. Layer 2 in the radio network layer is implemented as an Ethernet network. Power management and distributed scheduling for uplink transmissions in wireless systems To schedule uplink transmission time slots for a collection of mobile communication devices, a set of base station target interference patterns is associated with base stations. A time slot target interference pattern is assigned for each time slot and it repeats after several time slots. The time slot target interference pattern in a given time slot specifies the interference allowed by each time slot to a given base station by any single mobile. A priority index may be determined for each time slot for each mobile associated with the particular base station. The priority index may be based, in part, on a determined correlation between the time-slot target interference patterns and a potential interference profile of a mobile to which a time slot is to be allocated. A mobile's throughput requirement, the throughput already received over a specified past duration, the system fairness requirement, as well as the amount of data available for transmission are also used for evaluating the priority index. Wireless communication The invention is directed to a method of synchronising transmission between two nodes in a wireless network. The method comprises the steps of obtaining an expected interference profile for each node; and agreeing a synchronised transmission schedule between the nodes, where the expected interference profile of each node meets predetermined criteria. Cache locking device and methods thereof A method and device for locking a cache line of a cache is disclosed. The method includes automatically changing a state of a cache line from a valid locked state to an invalid locked state in response to receiving an indication that a memory location external to the cache and corresponding to the cache line is associated with an access request by a processor or other data access module. Thus, the locked state of a cache line is maintained even after data in the locked cache line is invalidated. By maintaining the invalid locked state, the cache line is not available for reallocation by the cache. This allows locked cache lines that become invalidated to remain locked without additional software overhead to periodically determine whether the lock has been lost due to invalidation of the cache line. Intelligent reputation attribution platform Systems and methods allowing for the attribution of reputation to data sources (e.g., for the creation of referrals) are provided. In an illustrative implementation scores (e.g., reputation scores) are determined for a target entity connected a source entity on a network on a given dimension. In the illustrative implementation, an entity may be directly linked to any number of other entities on any number of dimensions, with each link having an associated score. Illustratively, each dimension has an associated transitive dimension.

The multi-user packet is transmitted to the mobile station. CPU powerdown method and apparatus therefor A CPU has a powerdown mode in which most of the circuitry does not receive power. Power-up, coming out of powerdown, is achieved in response to receiving an exception. Because most of the state information that is present in the CPU is not needed in response to an exception, there is no problem in removing power to most of the CPU during powerdown. The programmer's model register file and a few other circuits in the CPU are maintained in powerdown, but the vast majority of the circuits that make up the CPU: the execution unit, the instruction decode and control logic, instruction pipeline and bus interface, do not need to receive power. Removing power from these non-critical circuits results in significant power savings during powerdown. The powered circuits are provided with a reduced power supply voltage to provide additional power savings. White balance adjustment device and color identification device The present invention is directed to improving the accuracy of white balance adjustment. An image input from an image capture device 10 is divided into blocks, and white balance gains are calculated from a representative value of each block. Prior to calculation of the representative value of each block, a color range determining circuit 13 determines whether each pixel included in each block belongs to a light source color range, or belongs to an apparent object color range. A representative value of that block is calculated from remaining pixels other than pixels determined to belong to the apparent object color range. Thus, by preventing the representative value from being affected by an object color, the accuracy of white balance gains is improved.

A mechanism is provided to enable the first mobile station to send a request for re-allocation of the channel portion. The request includes a real-time fast access associated control channel (RTFACCH) resource request message (RTRRM).

Initial ranging detection for OFDMA systems An initial ranging detection for an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless communication system entails removing data sub-carriers from samples of an OFDMA signal in order to suppress inter-carrier interference (ICI) between the data sub-carriers and initial ranging sub-carriers, coherently summing the resulting samples to boost signal energy, and applying a sliding window FFT to the coherently summed samples for correlating each result of the sliding window FFT with each one of a set of predetermined codes. The suppression of ICI is done by removing the cyclic prefix, performing an FFT to transform to the frequency domain whereupon the initial ranging sub-carriers are zeroed. An IFFT is then performed to return to the time domain. The cyclic prefix is then added and the new samples are subtracted from the originally received samples. The resulting samples are free of ICI and can then be coherently summed to boost signal energy.

Soft handoff method for uplink wireless communications Soft-handoff methods involve receiving an uplink signal from a user equipment at more than one basestation. The uplink signals are processed at each basestation before being backhauled to a common point for use to derive a single signal from the user equipment. One problem with previous types of soft-handoff methods is that relatively complex processing is required at each basestation in order to demodulate and decode the signals. It is also desired to further increase uplink capacity as compared with known types of soft-handoff methods. This is achieved by backhauling signals without carrying out any decoding of the uplink signal at the basestation. The backhauled signals are combined at a common point using maximal ratio combining before being fully demodulated and decoded. As a result capacity is increased and required user equipment transmit power is reduced.

Frame structures supporting voice or streaming communications with high speed data communications in wireless access networks A frame structure that is ordinarily optimized for providing variable high data rates also includes the flexibility to efficiently carry lower data rate, lower latency frames using sub-framing. Superframes, each comprised of a predetermined number of frames, carry voice and data communications at one or more variable data rates. The size of a superframe is limited, such as by the delay tolerance for voice transmission, typically 20 ms. Each voice customer is allotted one or more frames or portions of frames within the superframe, called sub-frames, as is needed to deliver the lower data rate, low latency voice communication. The allocation for the voice customers is not fixed, but varies as the data rate varies over time. Any bits in a frame that are not needed to carry voice communication are assigned to carry data having compatible data rate requirements. Additionally, the sub-framing concept may be extended to include ATM cells. Beamforming for non-collaborative, space division multiple access systems A wireless communication system noncollaborative, multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) space division multiple access (SDMA) system determines subscriber station combining and weighting vectors that yield a high average signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR). Each subscriber station independently transmits information to a base station that allows the base station to determine a weight vector wi for each subscriber station using the determined combining vector of the subscriber station. The ith combining vector corresponds to a right singular vector corresponding to a maximum singular value of a channel matrix between a base station and the ith subscriber station. Each subscriber station transmits signals using a weight vector vi, which corresponds to a left singular vector corresponding to a maximum singular value of a channel matrix between the ith subscriber station and the base station. The base station uses the weight vector wi to determine the signal transmitted by the ith subscriber station. System access and synchronization methods for MIMO OFDM communications systems and physical layer packet and preamble design A method and apparatus are provided for performing acquisition, synchronization and cell selection within an MIMO-OFDM communication system. A coarse synchronization is performed to determine a searching window.

The correlations are performed in the frequency domain of the received signal. In a multiple-output OFDM system, each antenna of the OFDM transmitter has a unique known value. The known value is transmitted as pairs of consecutive pilot symbols, each pair of pilot symbols being transmitted at the same subset of sub-carrier frequencies within the OFDM frame.

A variable voltage is applied to the liquid crystal material (46) for the lens power according to the zoom focus setting. Dynamic switching between maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) and linear equalizer for single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) in a global system for mobile communications (GSM) system In a GSM/EDGE Single Antenna Interference Cancellation (SAIC) operation environment, a mobile station is required to operate in a wide range of interference levels. An SAIC linear equalizer that takes advantage of the GMSK signal structure performs better than a conventional Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation (MLSE) equalizer in high interference levels, while it performs worse in low interference levels. A dynamic selection between the SAIC linear equalizer and the MLSE equalizer for each received burst is achieved to provide the optimal performance across the entire required operation environments. The dynamic selection is based on the estimated noise plus interference energy relative to the total received signal energy. The soft information calculated by the two categories of equalizers is properly scaled to generate soft information with balanced magnitude. Blind bandwidth detection for a sample stream A method for determining a bandwidth of a complex valued sample stream may include correlating a first portion of a preamble symbol of the complex valued sample stream with a second portion of the preamble symbol to generate a time autocorrelated portion.

Wireless receiver for removing direct current offset component A wireless receiver includes a hardware (HW) block, a converter block and a digital signal processor (DSP). The HW block receives a wireless signal having a first DC Offset Component (DCOC), removes a portion of the first DCOC to produce a residual DCOC centered at DC, and generates parameters that estimate the residual DCOC. The converter block is coupled to the HW block and receives the residual DCOC centered at DC and converts it to a residual DCOC centered at IF. The DSP is coupled to the HW block and the converter block and receives the residual DCOC centered at IF from the converter block and the parameters from the HW block, and uses the parameters to eliminate the residual DCOC, and generate a baseband signal that is substantially free of the first DCOC and the residual DCOC.

Method and apparatus to protect wireless networks from unsolicited packets triggering radio resource consumption A wireless communication method and wireless gateway device are provided for wireless communication between a wireless mobile station and a remote device. An unsolicited data packet is received from a remote device in which the data packet is addressed to the wireless mobile station. A determination is made as to whether to engage in a communication synchronization handshake with the remote device. The determination is based at least in part on the unsolicited data packet. A communication synchronization handshake with the remote device is performed without transmitting the received data packet to the mobile station upon determining to engage in a communication synchronization handshake with the remote device. A communication session is established with the wireless mobile station when the communication synchronization handshake with the remote device is successful. Data packets are forwarded between the wireless mobile station and the remote device when communication synchronization handshake with the remote device is successful and when communication with the wireless mobile station is established. Establishing a communications session having a quality of service in a communications system A communications system includes a packet-based wireless network linked to mobile units and a circuit-switched network such as a public-switched telephone network (PSTN). A primary Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context is established with call setup that contains the default quality of service (QoS) profile of the call session. However, to support multiple flows with different QoS profiles, secondary PDP contexts with different QoS profiles may be activated in the call session. The secondary PDP context activation may be performed using messaging according to a protocol for reserving resources, such as the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP). MIMO precoding enabling spatial multiplexing, power allocation and adaptive modulation and coding In a closed-loop wireless communication system, a codebook-based feedback mechanism is provided to enable non-unitary precoding for multi-stream transmission, where in each stream is optimized with suitable transmission power allocation and AMC. The codebook-based feedback mechanism uses a precoding codebook having a power allocation matrix which is constrained to specify that beamforming always applies full power to a predetermined beam. With this constraint, a one-bit power allocation feedback index may be used to switch between beamforming and spatial multiplexing. Transmit power allocation in a distributed MIMO system Allocate power so as to maximise the throughput of each user of a multi-user MIMO group, with the constraint that over time all users in the group have equal throughput. This differs from equal capacity per slot in that each user may be assigned multiple slots as well as unequal power. This is illustrated in FIG. 4. Total throughput is maximised on any given slot for any two users. Power is shared between the spatial modes such that the total number of slots used by the two users is minimised. The membership of the MIMO group may change between slots and thus throughput is not necessarily equalised on a slot by slot basis. System and method for implementing ACLs using standard LPM engine A method, data processing system, and computer program product are provided for retrieving access rules using a plurality of subtables. An incoming packet that includes fields of data is received from a network. A key is formed from the fields, the key includes a number of subkeys. The subkeys are selected and each of the selected subkeys is used to search a different subtable. If a subtable entry is a pointer, a next level subtable is searched until a failure or data is encountered. If a failure occurs, a default rule is applied. If data is encountered, the key is masked using a stored mask value. The resulting masked key is compared to a stored rule. If they match, the identified rule is applied, otherwise the default rule is applied. Computer-based networking service and method and system for performing the same Methods and systems for assisting individuals (101) arrange meetings such as networking meeting with other individuals (101) at a specified time (or within a specified time range) and/or at a specified place (or within a specified geographic region). More specifically, methods and systems for allowing individuals (110) to post an invitation to for a meeting on an on-line network and for allowing one or more other individuals (101) to accept such invitation. Dual protocol layer automatic retransmission request scheme for wireless air interface A base station, mobile station, and/or other terminal device includes physical layer (layer 1) protocol and link layer (layer 2) protocol that both include automatic retransmission request (ARQ) operations. The physical layer and link layer include enhancements that interact with one another to cause the link layer to inhibit ARQ operations while error recovery operations are pending at the physical layer. A transmitter packages link layer packet data units into physical layer frames and transmits the physical layer frames. A receiver responds to indicate either successful or unsuccessful transmission. The transmitting physical layer waits for the response and initiates error recovery operations when required. The receiving link layer, when it detects lost data packets, inhibits its ARQ operations to allow physical layer error recovery operations to complete. Wireless network communications Currently, networks are used within most enterprises to allow for sharing of resources such as printers and to allow for central server features to be available such as backup operations, shared files, and internal email. With the introduction of the third generation of wireless communication networks in which a mobile station can have an always on capability, private networks can now be established between mobile stations. In these implementations, the mobile stations each have a Home Location Registration (HLR) and a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address. The mobile stations within a private network are listed within a table stored in the intelligent peripheral by their HLRs. The intelligent peripheral regulates the flow of data units within the wireless network by determining if the sender of a packet and the intended recipient are within the same private network. Address translating program, address translating method, and address translating apparatus An address translating program enables a server to identify the addresses of clients without the need for any special processing on the side of the server. When a computer receives a request packet, which has a source address translated into the address of a proxy server, output from a client to a server, via the proxy server, the computer analyzes contents of the request packet to acquire the address of the client. Then, the computer translates the source address of the request packet into the acquired address of the client and transmits the request packet to the server. Then, when the computer receives a response packet in response to the request packet from the server, the computer translates a destination address of the response packet from the address of the client into the address of the proxy server, and transmits the response packet to the proxy server.
